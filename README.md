## Resources

Brastlewark uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [React](https://reactjs.org) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* [Material UI](https://material-ui.com) - React Components that Implement Google's Material Design.
* [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js.
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
* [react-lazyload](https://github.com/jasonslyvia/react-lazyload) - Lazy load your component, image or anything matters the performance.
* [react-transition-group](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group
) - An easy way to perform animations when a React component enters or leaves the DOM.
* [react-table](https://react-table.js.org) - A lightweight, fast and extendable datagrid built for React.
*  [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) - Declarative routing for React.

And of course Brastlewark itself is open source with a public repository on GitHub.
